# kivy_game_of_life
## What is it?
<p>This project is a classic conway's game of life build in Kivy(multiplatform, naturaly resizable framework)</p>

## How does game of life work?
### Explanation from a quick google search
<p>The Game of Life (an example of a cellular automaton ) is played on an two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead. The status of each cell changes each turn of the game (also called a generation) depending on the statuses of that cell's 8 neighbors.</p>

### My explanation
<p>There is a grid of cells, that are either alive or dead. Every 0.1 - 5 seconds a cycle starts. The cycle decides whether the cell stays alive or dies based on the amount of alive neighbors of the cell. Hopefully this makes sense. If not read the explanation above or google conways game of life.</p>

<p>Video of this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XkXqGcKzcA </p>
<p>At the end of the video you can see a stable formation of cells (infinite loop).</p>

## Features
<p>Resizable grid.</p>
<p>Settings window(custom size of the grid, select random tiles option).</p>
<p>Label displaying the number of cycles that passed</p>
<p>Adding cells while the game loop is running</p>
